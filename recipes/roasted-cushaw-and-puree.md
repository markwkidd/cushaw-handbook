# Roasted Cushaw Squash and Puree

Oven-roasting is a foundation for many winter squash recipes. The roasting process is the same for winter squash cushaws as other species of squash.

{: .warning }
Because the rind of a hardshell squash fruit does not soften as much with roasting, be careful to avoid getting pieces of shell into the puree if yours has a hard shell.

## Freezing
Raw squash pieces and puree can both be frozen. For a large winter squash fruit, a cook might store the fruit for a few months whole at room temperature. Then when the squash is first needed, the cook might prepare half of it, and freeze the other half either raw or as puree.

## Ingredients

- 1 or more squash fruit
- Cooking lard or oil
- Salt

## Equipment and supplies

- Oven
- One or more baking trays or casseroles
- Parchment paper or aluminum foil
- Chef's knife
- Scoop or large spoon
- Bowls
- Potato masher or something similar
- Colander

## Instructions


1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit.

2. Cut the squash fruit into pieces that are relatively flat. The flesh in the neck is often thicker than the flesh around the seed cavity. Suggestion: You may consider splitting the neck in half, and roasting those two pieces in a separate tray so that they can be roasted longer than the other parts.

3. Line your baking trays, pans, casseroles, etc with parchment paper or aluminum foil.

4. Mix oil and salt into a bowl. Using a brush, piece of parchment paper, or other method, lightly coat the flesh with the mixture.

5. Place a single layer on the baking tray with the inside downward. For neck pieces, this means placing the cut side downward.

6. If all the are approximately the same thickness, then you only need to set one timer. Fruit at room temperature with flesh up to 1.5 inches thick can be roasted in about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Thicker flesh should be roasted for a longer period of time.

7. The the edges of a squash piece will brown when the piece is fully roasted. One it cools, use a scoop to separate the flesh from the rind. Then use a potato masher, food processor, or other approach to mix the flesh until it reaches puree consistency.
