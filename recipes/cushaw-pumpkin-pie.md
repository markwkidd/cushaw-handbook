There is a long tradition of baking desert pies from cushaw squash. In some areas, cushaws are even known as 'pie pumpkins'.

This recipe comes to us by way of Wheelersburg, Ohio, from Mark Kidd's grandmother. Grandma Gleim received the recipe in a community cookbook, titled "Peter's Pumpkin Pie". This recipe may have been historically created or promoted by a condensed milk brand.

{: .note }
This recipe calls for cushaw puree. [A recipe for cushaw puree](../roasted-cushaw-puree) is available in this handbook.

## Ingredients

- 1 unbaked pie shell
- 2 cups [cushaw puree](../roasted-cushaw-puree)
- 1 can sweetened condensed milk (10 fluid ounces or 14 ounces by weight)
- 2 eggs
- 1/2 tsp. salt
- 1/2 tsp. ginger
- 1 tsp. cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp. nutmeg
- (Optional) Whipped cream and nuts for garnish

## Equipment and supplies

- Oven
- Large mixing bowl
- Pie pan
- Mixing spoon
- (Optional) Metal knife for testing

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit.
2. In a large bowl, combine ingredients; mix well and turn into shell.
3. Bake 15 minutes, then reduce oven heat to 350 degrees and continue baking approximately 40 minutes. The sides of the pie will be set but the center will still be wobbly. A knife inserted 1 inch from the edge will come out clean.
4. Cool the pie completely before cutting and serving. Garnish if desired with whipped cream and nuts.

Pies should be stored in the refrigerator and will keep for a few days. You can also freeze a pie immediately after it cools down by wrapping the pie tightly in layers of plastic wrap.
