# Returning seeds

Community seed projects succeed when gardeners share seeds from successful plants. Sharing is central to the ongoing, ancient work to maintain diverse, locally-adapted crops around the world.

- Submit seeds to the Commonwealth Cushaw Project at PO Box 591, Whitesburg KY 41858.
- Submit to [Going to Seed](https://goingtoseed.org/").
- Consider researching nearby seed libraries and swaps.

The following information will be helpful when sharing your seeds:

- Plant and species name.
- Variety or original source.
- Grower name.
- Garden location and year.
- Email or phone.
- Describe the parent plants or fruits with any significant traits.
