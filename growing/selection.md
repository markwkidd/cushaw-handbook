# Selection

This section explores ways to identify exceptional plants among the population (a process known as "selection"). In order to understand how selection relates to sexual propagation in squash, this section incorporates concepts related to manual and open pollination.

## What is Selection?

In this guide, "selection" refers to actions taken by the gardener to choose which plants should be prioritized, which might be manually "crossed" together in the pursuit of a hybrid, and which plants should be culled or eliminated.

### Selection for an established variety

Whether you are maintaining an existing heirloom variety or a diverse landrace of plants, the work of selection is focused on elimination -- or "roguing" -- plants with undesirable characteristics, while making sure to save ample seed from plants which do exemplify the variety.

### Selection for a new variety

When developing or improving a genetic line, selection might instead be focused on what to include. In this scenario it is most important to identify and prioritize plants that stand out from the rest in positive ways.

## Selecting cushaws

If you are maintaining an existing variety or taking part in a community seed program, there may be certain characteristics that you are hoping to include or exclude from your squash.

These are some cushaw squash traits that the grower can consider during the course of the season:

- Fruit size, shape, and color
- Seed size, shape, and quanitity
- How vigorously does it grow
- How early and prolifically the vine produces fruit

One option is to tie strips of bright cloth or bright-colored survey flagging tape to plants that the gardener has selected or want to monitor. Some gardeners also write directly on the maturing fruit to keep track of individuals with promising characteristics.

## Squash genetics and pollination

If you have two or more plants which demonstrate exceptional characteristics, you might consider manually cross pollinating them.

Squash plants have separate male and female flowers, and usually both types can be found on healthy adult squash plants. The ‘mother’ flower contributes the unfertilized fruit which develops between the flower and the stem. The ‘father’ flower is attached to the vine by a long stem and appears earlier than female flowers, and can be on the same plant or another plant.

> **What other squash will cushaws cross with?**

>Cushaws of species C. argyrosperma have been noted in English scientific literature to form hybrids with Cucurbita maxima and Cucurbita pepo. However, these hybrids should be considered very unlikely to occur via natural pollination.
>Cross pollinations with Cucurbita moschata varieties are more common, but still rare. If you find a cushaw fruit with an unusual shape or other indication of interspecific cross, you are lucky indeed!

Pollen is transferred by insects or humans from male flowers to female flowers in order to start fruit development. Without pollination, the immature fruit will eventually wither and fall off the plant. The seeds are the 'babies' (sometimes called the F1 generation) that develop in the fruit (ovary) of the female plant. Because the seed coat comes from the mother, all the seeds look the same. But inside, each carries a unique combination of its mother’s and father’s genes.

[Sprouted Garden has a useful article about squash pollination](https://sproutedgarden.com/hand-pollinate-squash/), including manual pollination, with side-by-side photos of female and male flowers. Pollination information written for any of the domesticated squash species in the Cucurbita genus can be applied to cushaws.
