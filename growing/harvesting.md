# Harvesting

When night temperatures drop below 50 degrees Fahrenheit, cushaw vines may stop producing flowers.

> C. argyrospemera cushaws are believed to generally be **less sensitive to cold** than C. moschata winter squash. They are generally **more sensitive to cold** than C. ficifolia, C. maxima, or C. pepo squash.

## When are cushaw fruits mature?

In general, winter squash are ready to harvest for seed saving around 60 days after a fruit is successfully pollinated (this time is sometimes referred to as when the fruit "sets"). Some varieties may continue to mature in terms of culinary quality past that period. If the vine still seems healthy and the peduncle has not dried completely after 60 days, and no frost has been predicted, consider leaving the fruit on the vine longer to continue accumulating nutrients.

One sign that winter squash is done ripening on the vine is that the stem may become brownish and start to dry. In some regions, growers wait until a light frost to harvest because the vine will die back, making it easier to find all the squash. If a hard frost is predicted, it is better to bring in the fruit or cover them overnight with a blanket. Damage from frost can shorten the storage life.

Immature fruit that remains at the end of the season may still be usable like a summer squash.

To harvest, cut the peduncle or stem 1 - 3 inches above the fruit. Do not use the stem as a handle, and leave it attached to the fruit. Stem removal may allow insects or disease to enter the fruit, reducing its storage life.

## Curing and storage

Once cut from the vine, the squash should be 'cured' for long-term storage. This means allowing the fruit to air dry at a warmish temperature (80° F is the ideal), either indoors or outdoors depending on weather conditions, with good ventilation for 5 - 7 days before storing at cooler temperatures (50 - 60° F), again with good ventilation and some humidity. Squash should be turned periodically and inspected for soft spots or mold, and you should eat those starting to spoil first.

It’s also a good idea to eat the smaller fruits before the larger ones as they tend not to store as long.
