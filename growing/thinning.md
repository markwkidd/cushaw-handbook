# Thinning

If your planting has gone well, there may be more cushaw vines than will fit when they are full sized. Some growers allow excess seedlings to compete for survival, while others practice thinning.

If you have more garden space in another location, you might also relocate some plants, or give away the excess seedlings.

## When to evaluate

When to evaluate. Most seedlings seem healthy while they are nourished by their cotyledons. Vigor becomes more apparent once seedlings develop two pairs of true leaves and begin to metabolize their own nutrients.

## Diversity

Positive traits that are evident at this stage of development include:

- Sturdy thick stems, not leggy.
- Green leaves with no yellowing, browning, or insect damage.
- Vigorous growth.

In addition to prioritizing these traits, also look for differences between plants, and encourage diversity among healthy seedlings. Some vines will be better able to resist pests and make good fruit in your conditions. Later in the season, the work of thinning transitions to the work of _Selection_: identifying the most promising squash seeds for the next season.

## How to thin

Use scissors or secateurs to cut the vine just above the soil to avoid disturbing the roots of other nearby plants.

[This video from Mills Family Gardening](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hgc4abin7wE) demonstrates how to separate seedlings for replanting.

There is no single right way.

## Squash harvests begin with thinned plants 

Squash plants can provide you with food even before the first fruit has matured. If youâ€™ve been fortunate and have too many seedlings, try eating the culled plants.

- Squash vine tips are clipped and used as greens in cooking.
- Both male and female flowers are eaten in several ways.
- Immature fruits can be eaten as summer squash during the season, or when frosts are in the forecast and not all fruit will reach maturity.
