# Cushaw growing guide

## Schedule

Cushaws are not frost tolerant. Seedlings thrive in late spring and early summer after danger of frost, when the soil reaches 60Â° Fahrenheit.

It may be useful to try to find out if there are traditional times recommended to plant winter squash in your area. Winter squash cushaws require 60 days after fertilization in order to produce viable seeds, but producing high quality flesh often requires additional time on the vine. Work backwards from the date of fall frost danger to ensure you plant the cushaws with enough time to mature.
