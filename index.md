**This guide is intended to help people grow and use tasty, nutritious cushaw squash.** It was initially developed by the Commonwealth Cushaw Project, a partnership of [Handbarrow](https://handbarrow.org/) and [Renew Appalachia](https://renewappalachia.org/) in Kentucky, USA. It has been built with technical assistance and resources from the [Going to Seed](https://goingtoseed.org/) crop guide project and an intercultural microgrant from the [Kentucky Rural-Urban Exchange](https://kyrux.org/).

## What are cushaws?

**Cushaw**, or **kershaw**, is the most common name in English for the botanical species of squash _Cucurbita argyrosperma_, and likewise most squash varieties that are called cushaws are part of that species. This guide will use cushaw interchangeably with the species _C. argyrosperma_.

{: .note }
> Due to historic changes in the understanding of squash botany, some squash of species _Cucurbita moschata_ are referred to as cushaws, for example the _Golden Cushaw_. This guide is not focused on C. moschata varieties like the Golden Cushaw. That species requires similar growing conditions, but there are differences.

Different types of cushaw squash have been bred for different purposes such as edible seeds, summer squash, and long-keeping winter squash. Some types are used for more than one purpose.
