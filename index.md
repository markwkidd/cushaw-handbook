This guide is intended to help people grow and use tasty, nutritious cushaw squash. Some cushaws have been bred for tasty edible seed, and others for prolific summer squash or long-storing pumpkin characteristics. Some kinds of cushaw serve multiple roles.

## What are cushaws?

_Cushaw_, or _kershaw_, is the common name in English for the botanical species of squash _Cucurbita argyrosperma_. The cushaw was domesticated in Mexico and it has traditionally been grown in the approximate region from Nicaragua to the Southeastern United States.

- **Days from planting to harvest**: 60 for summer squash, 90-120 for winter squash and seeds.
- **Planting dates:** After the last danger of frost, when soil reaches 60Â° Fahrenheit.
- **Light:** At least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily. A small amount of shade can be helpful.
- **Days to germination:** 3 - 7

{: .note }
> Some squash varieties historically called cushaw, like _Golden Cushaw_, are now known to be _Cucurbita moschata_, a different botanical species. This guide focuses on _C. argyrosperma_ cushaws.
