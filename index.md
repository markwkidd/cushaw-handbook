This guide is intended to help people grow, use, and save seeds from tasty, nutritious cushaw squash. Some cushaws have been bred for tasty edible seed, and others for prolific summer squash or long-storing pumpkin characteristics. Many varieties of cushaw serve multiple roles.

Cushaws can often be grown with minimal irrigation or inputs like fertilizer, herbicide, or pesticide. This guide presents a low-input approach to cultivation. It also includes seed saving concepts and procedures that can be used to select and share seeds that become more adapted to your climate each season.

### What are cushaws?

_Cushaw_, or _kershaw_, is the common name in English for the botanical species of squash _Cucurbita argyrosperma_. The cushaw was domesticated in Mexico and it has traditionally been grown in the approximate region from Nicaragua to the Southeastern United States. The Commonwealth Cushaw Project began in the mountains of Eastern Kentucky where cushaw squash has been an important winter "storage crop" since before memory.
