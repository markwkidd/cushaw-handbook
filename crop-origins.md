Like the other Cucurbita squash, all cushaws are native to the Americas.  The first example of a Curcubita species in cultivation is C. pepo which is believed to have been cultivated by inhabitants of Guilá Naquitz cave between 10,000 to 8,000 years ago.

Most squash traditionally called _cushaws_ are botanically classified as _[Cucurbita arygrosperma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucurbita_argyrosperma)_, but there are some cushaws of species _C. moschata_. This guide is focused on cushaws of species _C. argyrosperma_, including interspecific hybrids with demonstrable arygrosperma traits.

The species is believed to have originated in Mexico, from its wild *sororia* form. In precolonial America, archaeological remains have been found as far northward as the cultures of the Eastern Agricultural Complex. The extant native range of the wild sororia type is from northern Mexico through Central America to Nicaragua.

The earliest known possible archaeological records of C. argyrosperma are 8,700-year-old phytoliths in the Central Balsas River valley in Guerrero, but these remains are considered ambiguous. The earliest unambiguous specimen is a C. argyrosperma peduncle that has been dated to approximately 5,100 years ago, from the Ocampo caves.

Genetic evidence centers the domestication of C. argyrosperma in what is now Jalisco, Mexico. Other evidence suggests that following domestication and before European contact, C. argyrosperma diffused northward into what is now the eastern and central United States before European contact. C. argyrosperma seeds have been recovered from Late Mississippian archaeological contexts in Arkansas that suggest domesticated C. argyrosperma was established in that region 1,310–623 years ago.

Domestication involved genetic changes to attributes related to growing, handling, and using the plant. C. argyrosperma is thought to follow a domestication pattern similar to other Cucurbita, beginning with reduction of bitterness and an increase in seed size. In C. argyrosperma, attributes affected by domestication and selective breeding include:
* reduction in bitter taste from cucurbitacins
* increase in the size of fruits and seeds
* more uniform germination time
* reduced size and abundance of urticating trichomes (hair)
* diversification of fruit shape
