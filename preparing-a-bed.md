# Preparing a new garden bed

## Method 1: No-Till Cardboard Mulch

### Materials Needed:
- Cardboard sheets (without glossy coating or tape)
- Gardening tools (shovel, rake, wheelbarrow)
- Water source (optional)
- Rocks to hold down cardboard (optional)

### Steps:
1. **Site Selection**
   - Choose a location that receives at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily.
   - Ensure the area has good drainage.
   - Measure and mark the desired garden bed dimensions.
   - Remove any large rocks, sticks, or debris from the area.
   - Ideally, the cardboard should be applied at three or more months in advance. Humid climates or manually wetting the cardboard can reduce this time.

2. **Cardboard Layer**
   - Make sure there are no glossy coatings or tapes on the cardboard
   - Lay down overlapping cardboard sheets directly over the grass/weeds
   - Ensure complete coverage with no gaps

3. **Issues with Wind**
   - Wind can carry away cardboard if it is on the top layer and has not yet begun breaking down.
   - In some situations it may not be a problem for a few sheets of cardboard to blow around.
   - Options for reducing this issue include placing rocks or mulch on top of the cardboard or periodically wetting it until the cardboard begins to decompose.

5. **Waiting Period**
   - Allow the bed to sit three months before planting, although sometimes it is possible to plant in less time.
   - This gives time for the cardboard to suppress weeds and decompose.
   - The layers will break down, improving ground conditions.

## Method 2: Tilling Approach

### Materials Needed:
- Rototiller or tractor with tilling attachment, etc.
- Rake
- Shovel
- Wheelbarrow

### Steps:
1. **Site Selection**
   - Choose a location with full sun exposure
   - Verify good drainage
   - Measure and mark garden bed dimensions

2. **Initial Preparation**
   - Remove large rocks, sticks, and debris
   - Mow or cut existing grass and weeds as short as possible

3. **Tilling Process**
   - Set rototiller or tractor to a depth of 8-12 inches
   - Till the entire area, breaking up compacted soil
   - Make multiple passes to ensure thorough soil disruption
   - Work when soil is slightly moist but not wet

4. **Final Bed Preparation**
   - Rake the area to create a smooth, level surface
   - Remove any remaining large clumps or roots
   - Create slight mounds or raised areas if drainage is a concern


### Growing Tips:
- This squash variety prefers warm soil temperatures (around 70Â°F)
- Plant after the last frost date in your region
- Space plants 3-4 feet apart in rows 6-8 feet apart
- Provide support like trellises for vertical growth
